In order to generate the graph you have to run the scripts in this specific order:

```
python generate-toc.py
python generate-idx.py
python generate-nodes.py
python generate-graph.py
```

Make sure to have a Wikipedia Multistream Dump file, and the relative Index file, respectively in files/dump.bz2 and files/dump-index.txt.
